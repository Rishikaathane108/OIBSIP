            <h2>A brief summary of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was born on 14 May 1657 at Purandar Fort . Being a prince, he was exposed to battlefield
                campaigns and political maneuvers from an early age.
                
                Sambhaji Maharaj's mother, Maharani Saibai, died when Maharaj was young. After that, a woman named Dharau from Kapurhol
                village near Pune became his foster mother . Sambhaji Maharaj was looked after by his grandmother Rajmata Jijabai .
                
                His stepmother, Putalabai also doted on him. But his stepmother Soyrabai treated Sambhaji Maharaj as a child and tried to interfere in Sambhaji Maharaj's political career.

                According to many historical records, Sambhaji Maharaj was extremely handsome and brave. He was also a scholar in many languages and a very smart politician. He had fully absorbed the subtleties of politics. Shivaji Maharaj took him with him during his visit to Agra, thinking that if he got to know the affairs and politics of the Mughal court at an early age, it would be useful to him in the future . Sambhaji Raje was 9 years old at that time. After the escape of Shivaji Maharaj from captivity, the rush to Swarajya should not be borne by the Sambhaji kings and therefore it was necessary to keep them in a safe place for some time. So Shivaji Maharaj sent him to Moropant Peshwa's brother- in-law's house in Mathurakept In order to stop Mughal soldiers from pursuing Sambhaji Raja, Shivaji Maharaj spread the rumor of Sambhaji Raja's death. Some time after he reached Maharashtra, Sambhaji Maharaj reached Swarajya safely.

            <h3>Youth</h3>
            <p>
                A.D. By the time Shivaji Maharaj was enthroned in 1674 , Sambhaji Raje had become well versed in the subtleties of
                politics and battlefield tactics. With his humble nature, he welcomed the delegates who came to Raigad for the
                coronation.
                
                Jijau died 12 days after the coronation of Shivaji Maharaj. After that, there was no one left to pay attention to
                Sambhajiraj. Shivaji Maharaj was involved in Swarajya politics and on the battlefield.
                
                Young Sambhaji Raj often had disagreements with the experienced courtiers of Shivaji Maharaj. Sambhaji Maharaj was
                strongly against the administration of Amatya Annaji Dutt. Shivaji Maharaj often ignored Annaji's corrupt administration
                as he was an experienced and skilled administrator. But it was difficult for Sambhaji Maharaj to accept it. Annaji Datto
                and other experienced Mankaris went against Sambhaji Maharaj.
                
                Some courtiers began to abuse Sambhaji Maharaj; This was done only at the behest of Annaji Dutt. Due to their
                opposition, he could not go with Shivaji Maharaj on his campaign to South India. Also, in the absence of Shivaji
                Maharaj, the Ashtapradhan Mandal refused to follow the orders of Sambhaji Maharaj . So Shivaji Maharaj had to send
                Sambhaji Maharaj as Subhedar of Sringarpur in Konkan .
